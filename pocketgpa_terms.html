      <h5>Introduction</h5>
      <p>
        Below you will find details about the terms and conditions you agree to
        by using PocketGPA. I invite you to fully read and make sure you
        understand its contents prior to using PocketGPA.
      </p>
      <h5>Terms and Conditions</h5>
      <p>
        Tianna Henry-Lewis (the "Developer") operates the website and the
        PocketGPA mobile application (the "Service")also known as PocketGPA:
        Grade & GPA. Calculator(name on the AppStore subject to change for
        search and discovery purposes).
      </p>
      <p>
        The app is made available to you on an "as in", "with all faults", and
        "as available" basis.
      </p>
      <p>
        The app relies on the Firebase service offered by Google (Alphabet
        Inc.). Like any platform built on top of a 3rd party service subject to
        change, I cannot guarantee that the app will function or maintain the
        same level of service in the future. That is applicable for both free
        and paid users.
      </p>
      <p>
        Please read this section carefully since it limits the liability of
        PocketGPA. By using PocketGPA, your use of the app is at your own
        discretion and risk. PocketGPA makes no claims or promises with respect
        to the quality, the accuracy or reliability of the app, its security, or
        its content.
      </p>
      <p>
        To use PocketGPA you may have to grant some permissions for the app to
        access the features of your mobile device, such as notifications. These
        permissions are subject to change at any time while you use the app.
      </p>
      <p>
        By submitting support tickets within the app you authorize me to contact
        you via email in a reactive manner. I will not send unwanted emails but
        I might contact you directly via email if you send me a feedback or
        suggestion via the app or if you email me directly.
      </p>

      <h5>Subscriptions</h5>
      <h6>Payments</h6>
      <p>
        If you choose to purchase a PocketGPA Premium subscription, you must
        designate and provide information about your preferred payment method
        (e.g., credit card, online payment service, in-app purchase using your
        iTunes account, or any other payment method made available by us)
        (“Payment Method”). You will immediately be charged for these fees after
        you tap to buy a PocketGPA subscription. You agree to pay all fees
        incurred in connection with your username and password for your
        PocketGPA account.
      </p>

      <h6>Fees and Renewals</h6>
      <p>
        You may elect to buy either a PocketGPA Annual Subscription ("1 Year
        Pass") or a PocketGPA Monthly Subscription ("1 Month Pass") and pay
        subcription fees on a annual basis or monthly basis, respectively. All
        subcription fees are payable in advance. Subcription fees will be billed
        automatically to the Payment Method at the start of the annual or
        monthly period, as applicable, and will auto-renew until your
        subcription is terminated. The renewal subcription fees will be the same
        as the initial charges unless you are otherwise notified in advance. You
        authorize us to charge your Payment Method for the appropriate
        subcription charges and fees and for any other purchases you elect to
        make via the App. We reserve the right to increase subcription fees or
        to institute new fees at any time upon reasonable notice posted in
        advance on this App. If you upgrade your subcription or add new
        categories of service to your account, such changes may result in a new
        billing date effective upon the date you elect such upgrade or addition.
        ALL PURCHASES ARE FINAL AND NO REFUND WILL BE GIVEN FOR UNUSED PORTIONS
        OF YOUR INITIAL OR ANY SUBSCRIPTION PERIOD.
      </p>

      <h6>Cancellation</h6>
      <p>
        You may cancel your 1 Year Pass or 1 Month Pass by visiting the
        subscription management options within iOS. The cancellation of a
        subscription will go into effect at the end of your current billing
        cycle, and you will have the same level of access to the App through the
        remainder of such billing cycle. When your Pass ends, your account will
        enter free mode. No refunds or credits will be provided by us upon
        cancellation. You can renew your 1 Year or 1 Month Pass at anytime
        without opening a new account, provided that additional fees may apply
        if you decide to upgrade your subcription at a later date.
      </p>

        You agree that no joint venture, partnership, employment or agency
        relationship exists between you and the Developer as a result of the
        Terms or your use of the App. The Terms constitute the entire agreement
        between you and the Developer with respect to your use of the App. The
        failure of us to exercise or enforce any right or provision of the Terms
        shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. If any
        provision of the Terms is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to
        be invalid, the parties nevertheless agree that the court should
        endeavor to give effect to the parties’ intentions as reflected in the
        provision, and the other provisions of the Terms remain in full force
        and effect. You may not assign, delegate or otherwise transfer your

        version of the Terms and of any notice given in electronic form shall be
        admissible in judicial or administrative proceedings based upon or
        relating to the Terms to the same extent and subject to the same
