      <h5>Why do I need to collect and process some of your data?</h5>
      <p>
        For the Service to function as intended users are intended to submit
        data around their course codes and grades. The Service will only collect
        the information necessary to fulfill its feature list.
      </p>
      <h5>What kind of data is stored?</h5>
      <p style="font-weight: 600; color: #000">
        A. Personally Identifiable Data
      </p>
      <p>No personally identifiable data is collected and/or stored, without the users express permission. Users have the option to opt-in by creating an account, where at the point of account creating an email address will be required.</p>
      <p style="font-weight: 600; color: #000">B. Usage Data</p>
      <p>
        Anonymized information based on your usage of the app is collected in
        some cases. This is always done with the sole purpose of improving the
        experience for PocketGPA users.
      </p>
      <p>
        Examples: e.g. frequency and duration of usage, significant events and
        encountered errors if application has crashed etc. Some of this data is
        processed by Firebase Analytics (which tracks user engagement and major
        events happening inside the app to provide insights to developers) and
        Crashlytics (which provide crash reporting insights allowing developers
        to fix issues faced by users while they experience the app).

      <p>
        Internet address of your computer, tablet or phone is anonymized in the
        analytics service I use and these cookies are not used to identify you
        personally. You can <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout"

      <h5>Where is my data stored?</h5>
      <p>
        Firebase, a platform offered by Google, is used to store your data in a
        secure way. The tokens required to authorize access to the Firebase
        servers do not leave your device. Any data supplied by yourself is again
        anonymized, with the exception of any support tickets you submit through
        the app.
      </p>
      <p style="font-weight: 600; color: #000">
        Can I request that my data be deleted?
      </p>
      <p>
        Yes of course! If at any time you want your data to be deleted, by
        sending a support ticket within the app stating such a request, your
        data can be deleted upon request. Upon making such a request your data
        will be deleted in a timely manner. Once deleted, if you wish to use
        PocketGPA again in the future deleted data cannot be reinstated and you
        will have to start from scratch.

        I have more questions about my data?

      <p>
        If you have any questions about this policy and how your data is
        collected, used, and stored when you use PocketGPA, please feel free to
        send a support ticket from within the Settings page in PocketGPA. By the
        nature of how data is collected and anonymized, this is the only way to
        connect users with their data. If you have a general question that does
        not require access to your data, please feel free to email me at
        tianna.henrylewis@gmail.com with the subject line "PocketGPA - General
        Inquiry" and let me know how I can help you.

        posted on the page in a timely manner. We reserve teh right to modify
        the this policy at any time, so please review it frequently, or at the
        least, every app update.
